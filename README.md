# TOTVSLabsBeaconChallenge
This is a repository for source code of TOTVS Labs Beacon Challenge (TOTVER Guilherme de Cleva Farto).

All files developed for the proposed POC with Beacon technology are available in this repository.

Essentially, the following files / resources are stored:

1. Presentation in PPT format that describes the proposed use of beacons in agribusiness for plant health management (on farms);

2. Web application prototype that supports the management of employee activities and farms;

3. Mobile application prototype on the Android platform that makes use of the beacon of resources (with EstimoteÂ´Beacons) and integration with MQTT server (for IoT).
